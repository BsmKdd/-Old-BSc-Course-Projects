This is the project I worked on for 2 months, a gym system which includes 2 desktop applications, 2 android applications, and a simple web app.

You can read about the goal and functionality of the project in the System Design and Planning pdf.

The whole structure of the project is very messy, in another repo, I am starting on reworking this project and cleaning it up, in addition to moving it to a nodejs backend including Express, reworking the webapp to use ReactJS, a cleaner Electron application, and possibly rewriting the android application in Kotlin.

All of this is just a personal project in order to practice and strengthen my knowledge in some newly learnt technologies.

NOTE: Some modules and libraries will be missing, such as bootstrap, fontawesome, and possibly some node modules, as I was using the libraries locally, and did not upload them, I will probably come back to this and fix it.
